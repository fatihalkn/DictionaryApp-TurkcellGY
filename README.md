# DictionaryApp


I have reached the end of my self-made bootcamp assignments. In this project, I adhered to the MVVM architecture and worked entirely programmatically. I built a generic network structure using Alamofire and displayed the last 3 searched words in the search bar as soon as it is clicked. When I exit the search bar, I hide them. The last searched words are added to the third row.

## Libraries Used

- ProgressHUD
- Alamofire
